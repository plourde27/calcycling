Tunnel Road	3.08	4.7	765	3	2.8	3.5 (Downtown Berkeley)	https://www.strava.com/segments/5816161	Tunnel Road is the most popular Strava segment in the East Bay, and is used every year by Cal Cycling for time trials. As a result, most local cyclists know their fastest times up this climb, and will often try to improve it. The climb itself twists through residential Oakland hills, with the first half at a fairly constant 2-3% grade, and the second half (after you pass the Caldecott Tunnel) having some steeper sections approaching 10%.

Wildcat Canyon	2.38	4.8	613	3	6.5	2.3 (Orinda)	https://www.strava.com/segments/9657846	Wildcat Canyon is another classic East Bay climb, and it's featured in both directions in the popular Three Bears route. The climb follows Wildcat Canyon Road as it ascends through forest from Orinda to Tilden Regional Park. The first portion of the climb is both steeper and curvier than the rest.

Mt. Diablo (North Gate)	12.3	5.4	3675	HC	23.9	4.6 (Pleasant Hill)	https://www.strava.com/segments/1470688	Although it's not the steepest, Mt. Diablo is the hardest climb in the East Bay, according to the FIETS index. Starting from the North Gate park entrance near Walnut Creek, you follow North Gate Road and Summit Road all the way to the mountain's summit, which climbs nearly 3500 feet at an essentially constant 6% grade, except for the last hundred feet or so, which is much steeper (around 15%) and nicknamed "The Wall". The climb is grueling, especially on a hot day, but the view from the top is worth it - according to some sources, the amount of land you can see from the summit is second to Mt. Kilimanjaro among all mountains in the world!

Mt. Tamalpais from Fairfax	14.97	3.0	2396	1	25.1	16.6 (Richmond)	https://www.strava.com/segments/16491431	Mt. Tamalpais is a long and beautiful climb in Marin County. The climb starts in the town of Fairfax, and winds up Bolinas-Fairfax Road at a variable 5-10% grade. Somewhere along this section, your surroundings transition from residential Marin county to rural redwood forest, and after a bit of descending, you reach Alpine Lake, a scenic lake deep in the forest. After this, the road climbs steeply upward at an 8-10% grade for about 1.5 miles, at which point you take a left on Ridgecrest Boulevard. Ridgecrest Boulevard is one of the most scenic roads in the entire Bay Area - the road is surrounded by rolling grasslands with many hiking trails, and there are panoramic views of the ocean 1500 feet below you. After a steep but scenic climb up Ridgecrest Boulevard, the climb turns left onto East Ridgecrest Boulevard to make the final climb up to the West Peak of Mt. Tamalpais. During this final section, you climb 500 feet at a variable grade. The very end of the climb is quite steep (up to 15%), but the rest isn't too bad, especially compared to what you've just climbed to get here. Once at the top, you can continue onwards toward the East Peak (this involves 300 more feet of climbing in each direction), or turn back from here.
