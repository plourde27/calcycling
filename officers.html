      <p id="txt">Rishi started cycling as a weekend warrior, but like a lot of us, caught the racing bug pretty early on. Primarily a criterium racer, he took up cycling with a local team in his hometown of Greenville, South Carolina during the pandemic.
Above all, he just likes doing everything fast - whether it's sprinting to the finish of a crit, or flying through the countryside on the bike.
Rishi’s biggest accolades are in criterium racing and time trialing - winning a host of local titles in the southeast USA. Outside of Cal Cycling, he races with Supra Performance Cycling, and also enjoys other go fast hobbies including skiing and Motorsport.</p>

Alex placed 2nd overall in California and went to USACycling nationals for XC. He competes in XC, Enduro, and Downhill with notable finishes including first in WCCC men's SuperD and sixth at the Tahoe Trail 100 cat 1 XC. When asked skiing or snowboarding, it's snowboarding all the way.      </p>

He first started racing cyclocross before participating in NICA on the local high school team. He found his passion in cross country mountain biking, and now races competitively in the US Pro XCT and other events across the country.

Davis is looking forward to more mountain bike races this fall, and maybe some road racing in the spring if convinced. Outside of biking, Davis enjoys backpacking and fly fishing.</p>
