road,Base Ride,37.8,982,26,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33431800,"The Base Ride is a relatively flat and scenic ride that goes along the Bay Trail, and is popular with beginning and experienced riders alike.",route1.png
road,Mt. Diablo N/S,80,7722,97,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33425009,"Mt. Diablo is the hardest climb in the East Bay, and much of the elevation gain on this route comes from this massive climb. Starting from near sea level in Walnut Creek, the climb snakes up the mountain at a mostly constant 6% grade for 11 miles, eventually reaching a final elevation of 3849 feet. For a slightly shorter ride, you can take BART back from Walnut Creek or Pleasant Hill, which makes the total mileage 55 instead of 80.",route2.png

climbs,South Park Drive,10.3,1467,142,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33429172,"South Park Drive is one of the steepest climbs in Berkeley, and this route first takes you on Euclid and Wildcat Canyon Road before attempting this steep climb. This is a great route if you are looking for a short but hilly ride.",route20.png
climbs,Gradient Ascent (Centennial/El Toyonal),16.2,2589,160,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33429179,"Both Centennial and El Toyonal are incredibly long and steep climbs, especially El Toyonal, so this ride is an even better choice if you're looking for a short but super hilly ride. El Toyonal is not for the faint of heart - the last mile or so climbs at a seemingly endless 17-18% grade.",route21.png

road,The Three Bears,35.5,3709,104,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33429185,"The Three Bears is a classic Berkeley loop involving going out and back on Wildcat Canyon road, and taking an 18 mile loop on San Pablo Dam and Bear Creek Road. The 18 mile loop section was the course for the 2022 Berkeley Hills Road Race, and it's also used by the local Grizzly Peak Cyclists cycling club as a time trial segment.",route6.png
road,Redwood Pinehurst,28.2,2847,101,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33429180,"Redwood Pinehurst is arguably the most popular route around Berkeley, and for good reason - it's very scenic, and despite being on the shorter side, it still has plenty of hills, including the classic Tunnel Road, which is used by many as a time trial segment. Later in the route, you'll encounter the Pinehurst Road climb, which is steeper than Tunnel Road and has many hairpin turns.",route7.png

road,Treasure Island,23.1,767,33,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33431743,"Treasure Island is a fun route that goes to the Bay Trail and goes south along the Bay Bridge. Since it's relatively flat and consists of mostly bike trails, it's a great route for beginning riders.",route10.png
road,Mt. Tamalpais,81.9,5045,62,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33633048,"Mt. Tamalpais is an incredibly scenic ride that goes into Marin County and climbs first to Alpine Lake, and then to both summits of Mt. Tamalpais. Ridgecrest Blvd., which is included in the second half of the main climb, is one of the most scenic cycling roads in the entire Bay Area - it climbs along a grassy ridge, with amazing views of the ocean 2000 feet below you to the East. The ride can be made slightly shorter by ending in San Francisco (at the Embarcadero BART) instead of going all the way back to Berkeley.",route11.png
road,Paradise Out and Back,59,2007,34,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/38127622,"The Paradise Loop is a fun and relatively flat route through Marin County, that reaches the scenic coastal town of Tiburon.

road,Santa Cruz Mountains,76.3,5764,76,Beryessa/North San Jose BART,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40003842,"The Santa Cruz Mountains loop is a beautiful and hilly 76.3 mile loop south of San Jose. It's a bit far from Berkeley but is well worth the trip - outside of the very start and finish in San Jose, almost the entire route goes through redwood forest. There is a 2 mile unpaved section towards the beginning, but it is fairly light gravel for the most part and would be likely be feasible for road riders.",route15.png
road,Euclid/Grizzly/Claremont,11,1444,131,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40003911,"Euclid/Grizzly/Claremont is a short but fun loop in Berkeley - the entire route consists of climbing to the top of Grizzly Peak, and descending the steep Claremont descent, so it's a very satisfying ride, and a great choice if you only have an hour and want to get a ride in.",route16.png
road,Tunnel/Claremont,11,1288,117,UC Berkeley,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40003944,"Tunnel/Claremont is another great short route in Berkeley, and is a particularly good loop if you're looking to break your PR on Tunnel Road, but not do too long of a ride - like the Euclid/Grizzly/Claremont ride, it also includes a fun and fast descent on Claremont Road at the end.",route17.png
road,South Bay Loop,94.4,6441,68,Fremont BART,https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40003977,"The South Bay loop is a great loop that includes both Old la Honda and Tunitas Creek Road, two of the most classic South Bay climbs.",route18.png
